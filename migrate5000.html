## situation
* 10k RHEL (5k RHEL5, 4k RHEL6, 1k RHEL7)
* most of them subscribed to Satellite5/Spacewalk
* want to move to Satellite6/Foreman
* this requires a plan
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## tooling
* Satellite 6.1 (Foreman 1.7, Katello 2.2)
  * this was done about a year ago
  * the learnings also apply to Foreman itself
* `bootstrap.py`
  * script for registration of machines to Foreman/Katello
  * at that time not even part of the Katello project
  * mimicks the idea of `bootstrap.sh` from Spacewalk
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## `bootstrap.py`
* install `katello-ca-consumer` RPM
* subscribe the machine using `subscription-manager` or `rhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm`
* configure `katello-agent`
* configure Puppet
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## step 1: EL5?!
* ain't nobody got time for that
* just let it bit-rot on the old infra
* there is an migration to EL6/7 planned anyways
* (guess who is still up and running today?)
* no need to care for the old content
* but also no insight if there are any gotchas
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## step 2: size the infrastructure
* main VM: 12vCore, 32GB RAM, 1TB flash
* 6 proxies: 8vCore, 24GB RAM, 500G flash
* rough setup:
   * no machines connect directly to Foreman
   * no more than 1000 clients per proxy
   * most machines don't do Puppet
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## step 3: wait for firewalls
* there is always a firewall somewhere
* and it for sure will make you unhappy
* request the new firewall rules early and broadly (allow ALL the networks!)
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## step 4: design content
* the old setup provided almost only RHEL, apps were delivered from other sources
*  this makes an easy setup with one CCV per RHEL release, containing CVs for:
  * RHEL + SatTools
  * admin software (backup, monitoring, etc)
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## step 5: register all the machines
piece of cake, right?
</section>

<section data-markdown>
### step 5.1: find the right proxy
* most machines are subscribed to Spacewalk
  * find the old Spacewalk proxy in `/etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date`
  * have a map of old proxy to new proxy
* machine is not subscribed?
  * try guessing based on host/domainname
  * try guessing based on IPv4 subnet
* if everything fails, use a "default" proxy
</section>

<section data-markdown>
### step 5.2: find an executor
* you need to run a script on every single machine
* Spacewalk has a function for that, but it was disabled
* when a problem occurs during migration, Spacewalk might not be able to control the machine anymore
* today everybody would have used Ansible
* we had BMC BladeLogic, as that was what the customer had for all platforms
</section>

<section data-markdown>
### step 5.3: check that firewall
* nobody wants to schedule 5000 jobs that will fail
* run a quick pre-check job before doing the actual work
  * can the host resolve itself (and get a FQDN?)
  * can the host reach the old proxy
  * can the host reach the new proxy (on 80, 443, 5671)
</section>

<section data-markdown>
### step 5.4: wait for everybody
* the previous step will identify a lot machines as "broken"
* enjoy your coffee while waiting for the firewalls, machine owners, etc
</section>

<section data-markdown>
### step 5.5: test while waiting
* figure out which `bootstrap.py` parameters you need
* figure out which patches for `bootstrap.py` you need
* submit everything upstream
* become the de-facto maintainer of `bootstrap.py` upstream
</section>

<section data-markdown>
### step 5.6: register!
* we run batches of 1000 per day, so we would not affect too many departments
* `--skip foreman` as we did not care for Foreman/Puppet, just content
* `--force` as we sometimes just re-run the same machine multiple times
* `--legacy-purge` to remove the machine from Spacewalk
</section>

<section data-markdown>
### step 5.7: collect the pieces
* sometimes `rhsmcertd` would hang, blocking `subscription-manager`, blocking `yum`
* some machines have broken clocks, SSL terribly fails
* yes, we served "wrong" content to a couple boxes, but that was found quickly (missing repos)
* (broken) proxies in `yum.conf` make it hard to fetch packages
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## random findings
* BMC BladeLogic injects an own `libssl` using `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, breaking `yum`
* EL6.4 (and older) has a nasty Python bug, making all `syslog` calls `EMERG`
* People hate monitoring filesystems
* It is considered OK to leave a machine with broken dependencies
